         <h1>Final project proposal</h1>
         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>Sojourn</p>
         <p>We are a coffee shop in downtown San Luis Obispo with a mission to cultivate a culture of openness, authenticity, and compassion through quality brewed coffee. We hope you'll stop by and say hello.</p>
         <h2>Target audience</h2>
         <p>Our customers are coffee and tea drinkers with an interest in connecting with others. While our visitors tend to be young adventurers or working adults, we're eager to serve anyone who's interested in a cup of coffee, brewed with care.</p>
         <p>We aim to serve our community with openness and compassion. While Sojourn at its core remains a coffee company, we also open our doors to creatives and musicians who'd like to share their work. We hope that our coffee can be a bridge for new connections in both personal and professional spheres.</p>

            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>It began with a coffee craving in Jon Wong's international school dormitory in Budapest. For years, Jon immersed himself in the cultures of his travels and explored the flavors that have brought about our blends today.</p>
            <p>We hope the universal spices in our coffee will take you back to a good memoryâ€”or bring you closer to someone near you.</p>
