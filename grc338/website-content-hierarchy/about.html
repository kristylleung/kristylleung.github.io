                    <h2>Our Feelings Toward Food</h2>
                    <p>Ippudo has always believed that taste is not only experienced with the tongue. Naturally ingenuity is needed, which incorporates all five senses including sight and sound, but the elements of comfort and safety are also essential in taste. Ippudo carefully selects the ingredients, prepares the water, and maintains its cooking environment in perfect condition to ensure thorough cleanliness and organization. And then, these are brought to life through the hands of a master craftsperson. That’s why we do not grudge a single minute of time spent on developing our staff. Ippudo’s food, and naturally its ramen, was born on this unique foundation of “primary standards”.</p>
